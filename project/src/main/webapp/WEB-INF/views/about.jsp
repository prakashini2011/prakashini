<p>It was the summer of 1995 when prakashini and arundathi decided to open a pizzacart. With mouth-watering pizzas prepared by the founders themselves, Pizza cart soon became the most popular neighbourhood restaurant. From then to over 13,200 restaurants across the world today, we have come a long way.

Today, Pizza cart is about much more than pizzas. From freshly sauteed pastas & delicious appetizers to mocktails, desserts, soups and salads, we have a wide range for you to feast on. All this, combined with the warm, inviting ambience and friendly service, will lead to endless conversations, laughter and memories that you'll cherish forever. So, let your hair down and feel at ease. Go ahead and enjoy the All New Pizza Hut experience! </p>
